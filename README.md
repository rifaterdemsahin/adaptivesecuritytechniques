# Malicious Traffic Detection Console App

This is a simple console application that demonstrates how to detect and log malicious traffic based on IP addresses without notifying the malicious actor. The app simulates incoming requests, checks for malicious IPs, and logs any malicious attempts quietly into a log file.

## Features

- Detects malicious users based on their IP address.
- Logs malicious attempts into a console and a file.
- No direct notification to the malicious user.

## How It Works

1. The app simulates a list of incoming IP requests.
2. For each IP, the app checks if it is part of a known list of malicious IPs.
3. If the IP is flagged as malicious, the app logs the attempt in both the console and a log file (`malicious_traffic_log.txt`).
4. Non-malicious IPs are processed successfully, and a message is printed to the console.

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of C# and .NET console applications.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone this repository or copy the source code.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or any other C# IDE.
3. Build and run the application.
4. The console will display the results of processing the IPs.
5. Check the generated log file (`malicious_traffic_log.txt`) to view any malicious traffic attempts.

### Example Usage

The application simulates processing the following IPs:

```text
192.168.1.101 (Non-malicious)
192.168.1.100 (Malicious)
203.0.113.0 (Malicious)
10.0.0.5 (Non-malicious)
```

After running the app, you will see a log of any malicious attempts in the `malicious_traffic_log.txt` file.

## File Structure

- `Program.cs`: The main program logic that simulates IP traffic and logs malicious attempts.
- `malicious_traffic_log.txt`: The output log file where malicious traffic attempts are recorded.

## Customization

- You can modify the list of malicious IPs in the `IsMaliciousUser` method within `Program.cs`.
- The log format can be changed in the `LogMaliciousAttempt` method.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate with a database to dynamically check IPs against a larger list of known malicious addresses.
- Implement real-time alerting for malicious traffic detection.
- Expand the simulation to include more detailed traffic data.
